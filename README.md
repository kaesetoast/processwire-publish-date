processwire-publish-date
========================

Adds a publish date to every page

This is an extended version of what the ProcessWire community came up with in this thread: https://processwire.com/talk/topic/2448-show-date-published-on-a-page

## Configuration
I added an option to have the 'publish' field automatically created and added to all pages by default.

This option is disabled by default. If you don't want to use it, you'll need to create a 'publish' field of the type Datetime manually and add it to the templates you want it to appear on.

## Changelog

* 2014-10-09   v1.2.0   added option to change fieldname
* 2014-08-05   v1.1.0   changed field name to 'publish'
