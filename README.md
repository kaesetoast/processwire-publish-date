processwire-publish-date
========================

Adds a publish date to every page

This is an extended version of what the ProcessWire community came up with in this thread: https://processwire.com/talk/topic/2448-show-date-published-on-a-page

## Configuration
I added an option to have the publish_date field automatically created and added to all pages by default.

This option is disabled by default. If you don't want to use it, you'll need to create a publish_date field of the type Datetime manually and add it to the templates you want it to appear on.
