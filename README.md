processwire-publish-date
========================

Adds a publish date to every page

This is basically what the ProcessWire community came up with in this thread: https://processwire.com/talk/topic/2448-show-date-published-on-a-page/(https://processwire.com/talk/topic/2448-show-date-published-on-a-page/)

Seemed like nobody ever implemented this as a propper PW Module. I needed it as such, so I created it.
